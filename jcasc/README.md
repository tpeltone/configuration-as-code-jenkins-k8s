# JCasC in Docker

## Build

```bash
docker build -t tpeltone/jcasc-basic:2.222.3-1.39 .
```

## Run

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 tpeltone/jcasc-basic:2.222.3-1.39
```

Congratulations you now have a basic Jenkins configured as code!
    Notice the "Configured as Code!" text on the frontpage.

> NB: To speed up the demos, we've added configuration to the `Dockerfile`,
> to skip the setup wizard of Jenkins.
> An admin user can be configured later under
> `Configure Global Security, Security Realm, Jenkinsâ€™ own user database`.

When I'm doing the demos I've created a service account / bot user for GitHub,
    and added it as a collaborator to the repositories.
    It allows me to add a single SSH key to the service account and
    checkout with SSH using the same SSH key for multiple repositories.
    See "Machine Users" on
    [Managing Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users)
    for more information.

To let you do it without SSH, the "advanced examples" simply use HTTP;
    but here's the code.
